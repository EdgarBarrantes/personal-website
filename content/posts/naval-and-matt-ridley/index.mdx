So Naval is a person who's being heard by people that make things, Naval talks about choosing a "Rational Optimist" for a 
business partner, sounds like it makes sense to learn how to be a "Rational Optimist".

In the last podcast by Naval Revikant, he talks with Matt Ridley (who wrote ["The Rational Optimist"](http://www.rationaloptimist.com/)). 
Naval talks about being influenced by Ridley since he was young. Ridley appreciates that his ideas are being shared by a succesful wealth generator, 
proving them. They recognize how intelligent discourse is thus created by sharing and (im)proving ideas.
When Naval talks about a "Rational Optimist", he talks about Ridley's book.

In [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8jWUSmxkJg) Ridley intertwines economics and biology and weaves an argument 
for how trade and specialization has influenced human evolution. With further examples, and the idea that specialization 
means less time in order to produce more and better, he stablishes why analysing how since that started, overall we've been 
becoming more prosperous generation after generation particularly in places where trade is possible.

Naval talks in his [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6x6isq36gARjue0eQg5a0w?si=JrYwi9W-ROaip2rmP9NmaQ) about how creating wealth 
leads to abundance for the community, sharing on Ridley's idea. Hence making it an ethical choice weather of not to pursue wealth.

Whether or not Ridley argument is true, the fact is that this idea allows for the thinker (or replicator) to enter a positive feedback loop
in which he creates and improves his situation makes it a useful idea to have.
