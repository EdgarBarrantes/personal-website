Edgar Barrantes is a software developer. He has started several personal projects finishing very few, and is in the search of changing that behaviour. He will post here on anything he thinks it's useful for that purpose.

He also wants to make his personal portfolio, a place to post insights he's had and overall see what happens. Hence this site. He also feels uncomfortable with writing in the third person.

Currently a software developer at a Costa Rican company, has given talks of several subjects with the usual imposter syndrome all developers feel, and worked 4-5 years in the industry. Currently living in the mountainous side of Costa Rica with his girlfriend and their dog.
