<Title text="Why this site?" />

I mantain this site (if not so much these days) in order to remember myself and my mistakes better, in order for my future self to avoid them. Also it allows me to show what I'm doing, and what I'm learning. Hopefully this can be useful to you.

Posts tagged with "Learning" are notes on subjects I've researched about, usually they are a summary on a book chapter or a class.
