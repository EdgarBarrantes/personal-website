Rupert Spira analyses the  "I needed to become like you in order for you to become like me" line of a testament, he argues that for a person to be useful, 
one needs to create the pathways that make him divine. And that even if one is born know that one is divine, one would need to forget it, and find the pathways, 
in order to open them for others.

If one is born then, and is taught those pathways, without having been able to learn why those are The Pathways.
Then one would need to decide to forget them, in order to become useful for the community.
